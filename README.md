# IsItACat
A web app to classify pictures into two categories: cat and not cat. A convolutional neural network was trained on a dataset of ~30,000 cat images and ~25,000 images of other animals. Backend uses a Flask API to make predict calls while the frontend is constructed using Streamlit for simplicity.
